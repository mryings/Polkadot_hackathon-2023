# Demand Abstraction AA Wallet and Trading Bot Based on Intent-centric and AI Agent

 ## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

 With account abstraction (AA) and AI agent, we can upgrade intent-centric to demand abstraction as the ultimate way of user interaction on Web3, which is more natural, straightforward, and efficient than the current Web2 interaction based on Apps.

 With demand abstraction, users can directly express and meet their demands without going through specific accounts, DApps, and blockchains. After users specify their demands via user interface, text, or speech as inputs in our solution, our underlying AI agents will intelligently understand and analyze what users need, generate the best solution schemes to meet the demands of users and match the DApps and chains according to the solution scheme. After users check and approve the solution scheme, their AA account will automatically execute the solution scheme including running the corresponding DApps and operating multiple crypto assets to make transactions for users, and finally get what users want as execution results back to them. In this way, users can directly get what they need easily.

 Our demand abstraction solution will be fully open and decentralized. Although we will make a wallet as a sample to demonstrate and validate our demand abstraction, the demand abstraction functionality is open to all wallets to call and use. The third-party agents in AI and bundlers in AA are fully permissionless and decentralized, opening to all nodes to run and compete. After getting the execution results from third-party agents and bundlers, users can self-verify their correctness via the smart contract of AA as validation like zero-knowledge proofs. 

 Our project has been backed by the tech fund in HK, and enrolled in the incoming Polkadot blockchain academy. 

 ### Overview

 The high threshold, complexity and difficulty of user interactions and operations on blockchain are still too high to make Web3 usable for the ordinary users. For instance, if users want to convert USDT stablecoin in Ethereum into ARB token on Arbitrum, they need to find a suitable cross-chain bridge, connect to their account, then transfer their USDT and gas fee from Ethereum to Arbitrum, and then find a suitable DEX to exchange USDT for ARB with gas fee. It's so challenging, complicated, and troublesome for most users to understand and finish these steps by themselves. They have no way to simply express "I want to convert USDT into ARB",  and then directly get ARB without taking all those actions above by themselves. In order to do so, Web3 should support AI agent to intelligently analyze user demands and automatically run Apps to perform the corresponding operations in Apps for users, so users don't need to manually do so by themselves. 

 In our demand abstraction solution, after users express their specific demands via user interface, text, or speech as inputs, our underlying AI agent will intelligently understand them to analyze what users need, generate the best solution schemes to meet the demand of users, and then match the corresponding Apps according to the solution scheme. Based on the full inconnectuivity, interoperability and composability among Apps in Web3, our solution can automatically execute the solution scheme to run the corresponding Apps and perform the corresponding operations within Apps for users to get what they need. Finally we will get the execution results back to users to directly meet their demands in a highly efficient and intelligent way.

 ### Project Details
 Our experimental testing results show that with demand abstraction, we can attract 47% new crypto users to start making transactions on blockchain and exploring Web3 world. We also improve their trading efficiency by 62%, and increase their transaction volume by 1.8 times. For example, in the previous example, we can allow users to directly exchange their USDT for ARB without having to go through the tedious steps themselves. We can also transform various Web2 applications, such as helping users send their tweets to all social media accounts with one click, improving interaction efficiency and experience.

 The process of demand abstraction would be users can put forward and clarify their needs through voice, text, and user interface, etc. Then the wallet will intelligently understand and analyze user needs, and then generate the best solution scheme to meet the needs of users. â€¨After confirmed by users, we will automatically connect, combine and run different crypto asset applications and services in Web3 to help users perform and complete all operations on their digital assets.Finally, we will return the running results to users to meet their needs. After verification and confirmation, users accept and directly obtain what they need. The whole process involves the following techniques:

 **Web3 and Blockchain:** Based on blockchain, Web3 can break the barriers and isolation of Web2 Apps for full interconnectivity, interoperatblity, and composablity among Web3 Apps. Web3 can also support automatic execution within Apps, so users don't need to manually operate each App by themselves.  

 **AI Agent:** AI can intelligently understand the inputs of users via interface, text or speech to precisely analyze and get the demand of users. To meet user demands, AI will find, compare, choose, and combine all different Apps to generate the best solution schemes including what operations should be performed on which Apps.

 **Account Abstraction:** The decentralized bundlers enabled by account abstraction based on ERC-4337 can run their AI agent to generate the solution schemes for users. After getting users' authorization, they will execute the solution scheme to run and operate different Apps for users. Finally, they will get what users need back to users as the execution results. Different bunlders will compete with each other, so users can choose the best one to best meet their own demands.

 **Zero-knowledege Proofs:** Users can easily and quickly verify the correctness and effectiveness of both solution schemes and execution results provided by the bundlers. Users can also protect the privacy of their demands from being known or leaked by bundlers when getting and analyzing the demand of users.

 ### Ecosystem Fit

 One major obstacle to the mass adoption of Polkadot is the relatively high threshold and unfriendly experience when users interact with Polkadot blockchain. The on-chain operations are still complicated, troublesome, and unfriendly especially for ordinary new users, impeding them from using DApps and exploring Web3 in the Polkadot ecosystem. Therefore we need to have a better way of Web3 interaction for users to directly meet their demands and omit the technical details of the underlying Polkadot blockchain and DApps. 

 Therefore, our demand abstraction project can make the usage of Web3 not just as good as Web2, but even better than Web2 on Polkadot. Users can access and use Web3 in a more easy, natural, efficient, and convenient way. By providing a simpler and friendlier Web3 user experience, our demand abstraction can greatly lower the threshold, complexity, and difficulty of user interactions on Polkadot blockchain to onboard more users for the mass adoption of Web3.

 ## Future Plan

 1. Integrate our AA wallet to EVM-compatible chain on Polkadot
 2. Enable cross-chain demand abstraction among Polkadot and other blockchains
 3. Enable cross-chain demand abstraction among different parallel chains within Polkadot
